Size of sheets [Ls X Hs] = 25 X 18 (inches)
Left and Right Sheet space left, LR_space = 10 (cm)
Top and Bottom Sheet space left, TB_space = (w/2)+10 (cm)

Dimensions of box l X w X h = 115 X 75 X 75 (cm)
Gap for Ulti Pin and Sidhi Pin is G = 12 (cm)

Start Calculations
Length in x-direction = Ls
Margin in x-direction should not be negative Mx
1) Remove space of sides
     Mx = Ls - LR_space
2) Calculate number of box in x-direction
     Mx = Mx - 2*(l+w)
     Check Mx not negative
     if not negative than n_x_direction = 1
     else sheet size wrong

     Mx = Mx - 2*(l+w)
     Check Mx not negative
     if not negative than n_x_direction += 1
     else check y-direction now
     
Length in y-direction = Hs
Margin in y-direction should not be negative My
1) Remove space of sides    
     My = Hs - TB_space
2) Calculate number of box in y-direction 
     (Sidhi Pin)
     My = My - (h+w) - G
     Check My not negative
     if not negative than n_y_direction = 1
     else sheet size wrong

     (Ulti Pin)
     My = My - (l+w) - TB_space
     Check My not negative
     if not negative than n_y_direction += 1
     else

3) Next Set start
